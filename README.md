# DriverPass

**_Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?_**

The client is DriverPass and this project is a web-based application that provides students with driver training in preparation for their driver's license test. They wanted their system to allow their employees and customers a simplified way of signing up, scheduling appointments, taking online tests, and tracking test progress. Their goal is for students to be more prepared for their tests using their system.

**_What did you do particularly well?_**

I feel like my business requirements document was done well. I was able to show the functional and non-functional requirements of the system as well as the assumptions and limitations that come with this design. Also, the Gantt Chart that was included in the document I thought showed a clear schedule of what needs to be done by certain dates and which team is responsible. 

**_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_**

If I had to improve anything, I would say it's my UML Use Case Diagram in the System Design document. I think I got most of the components DriverPass requested but I know I missed some use cases that could have been included such as forgetting password or notification of DMV changes use cases. And on top of that, I could have included the DMV as another user who interacts with the overall system.

**_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_**

I was able to interpret the user's needs based on the interview and notes I took on what the owner was looking for. There were some parts of the design that he might not have requested but are just based on what he wants like having an incorrect login lockout after a certain amount of attempts. I think this is why it's important to consider the user's needs even if they didn't say it because there might be components that need to be included for the security or ease of the system. Users are going to be the ones interacting with the system the most, so making sure we give them something that is simple to use, provides security, and provides the driving support they need is important.

**_How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?_**

I think the best approach is to make sure you understand what the client is looking for. Really listen, take notes, and make sure you clarify what they want out of the system. Then, from there you can start designing everything. But without understanding the client's wants, it really leaves you lost in what you're creating. I think in the future, using diagrams and charts will be useful in understanding how the system needs to function.
